# Fenton growth curves - shiny app

## Usage
The purpose of this app is not to be a fully customizable growth chart plotter, this already exists at https://peditools.org/peditools_universal/. 

Values can only be entered through a HTTP GET request or through an Excel sheet (see template in this repository). 

For the HTTP GET request are the following parameters required:
- Gestational age (in weeks): `&PML_GET=23.14,23.28`. 23.142 equals 23 weeks + 1 day (=23+1/7).
- weight (in grams): `&weight_GET=400,500,600`
- length (in cm): `&length_GET=34,33,NA`
- head circumference (in cm): `&HC_GET=23,NA,25`
- Sex (M or F): `&sex_GET=M`
  
The number of comma separated values in each field needs to be equal, and needs to contain either a value > 0 or "NA".

In addition, an Excel file can be used to input and upload measurements (see example_excel.xlsx) in this Github repository. 

## Example URL
- Basic example: http://rubenvp.shinyapps.io/fenton/?advanced=yes&sex_GET=M&PML_GET=23%2B1/7,24%2B1/7,25%2B1/7&weight_GET=400,500,600&HC_GET=23,NA,25&length_GET=34,33,NA
- Real world example: https://rubenvp.shinyapps.io/fenton/?advanced=no&sex_GET=M&PML_GET=29.14,29.29,29.43,29.57,29.71,29.86,30.00,30.14,30.29,30.43,30.57,30.71,30.86,31.00,31.14,31.29,31.43,31.57,31.71,31.86,32.00,32.14,32.29,32.43,32.57,32.71,32.86,33.00,33.14,33.29,33.43,33.57,33.71,33.86,34.00,34.14,34.29,34.43,34.57&weight_GET=NA,1090,1040,1000,1010,1010,1110,1120,1180,NA,1140,1130,1190,NA,NA,1210,NA,1140,NA,NA,1275,1270,NA,1430,1410,1500,NA,NA,1655,1610,1610,1620,NA,1630,1750,1750,NA,1820,1860&HC_GET=26.3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,26.1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,27.1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,28,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,28.5,NA,NA,28.5,NA,NA,NA,29.5,NA,NA,NA&length_GET=38.6,38.6,NA,NA,39,NA,NA,38.2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,38.2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,40,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,42.5,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,43,NA,NA,NA

## Background and setup
The raw data (L,M,S values) was kindly shared by dr. Tanis Fenton (tfenton@ucalgary.ca). If you want to selfhost this app you'll also have to request access to this data. 

After obtaining the data, the Excel sheet need to be reworked so that it follows the format of the csv files in the `data` folder in this github repository (I have included the first 2 lines of my reworked csv files as example). After obtaining these csv files, reworked datafiles (containing P03 > P97 threshold) can be obtained with `growthcurves_*.R`. 

## Installation

The app can be used at [https://fenton.ugent.be](https://fenton.ugent.be/) or [https://rubenvp.shinyapps.io/fenton](https://rubenvp.shinyapps.io/fenton) or self hosted through Docker. 

```
docker run -dp 0.0.0.0:3838:3838   -v /data:/srv/shiny-server/data  --platform linux/amd64 rmvpaeme/fenton:0.3
```

The `data` folder should contain:

```
- boys_HC.csv
- boys_length.csv
- boys_weight.csv
- boys_all.csv # output from growthcurves_boys.R
- boys_all_spread.csv # output from growthcurves_boys.R
- girls_HC.csv
- girls_length.csv
- girls_weight.csv
- girls_all.csv # output from growthcurves_girls.R
- girls_all_spread.csv # output from growthcurves_girls.R
```

You'll have to generate these csv files yourself after requesting the raw data (see above). Examples are available in this github repository.

Afterwards, the app can be found at:

```
localhost:3838
```

or

```
server-ip:3838
```
